# react-inner-image-zoom

[Demos](https://laurenashpole.github.io/react-inner-image-zoom)

A React component for magnifying an image within its original container. The zoom behavior is triggered on click and the image can be moved by dragging on touch devices and by either dragging or hover panning on non-touch devices. The component supports responsive images and optional fullscreen zoom on mobile.

## Installation

### NPM
```
npm install react-inner-image-zoom
```

### Yarn
```
yarn add react-inner-image-zoom
```

### Styling

I was originally importing the CSS directly into the component but I've recently realized that makes too many assumptions about the wider build process. You can now download the raw CSS file at:

[/src/InnerImageZoom/styles.css](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurenashpole/react-inner-image-zoom/master/src/InnerImageZoom/styles.css)

or the minified raw minified version at:

[/src/InnerImageZoom/styles.min.css](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurenashpole/react-inner-image-zoom/master/src/InnerImageZoom/styles.min.css)

to include however you see fit. Or, if your setup supports it, import the files directory from your `node_modules` using:

```javascript
import 'react-inner-image-zoom/lib/InnerImageZoom/styles.css';
```

or:

```javascript
import 'react-inner-image-zoom/lib/InnerImageZoom/styles.min.css';
```

## Usage

Import and render the component:
```javascript
import InnerImageZoom from 'react-inner-image-zoom';

...

<InnerImageZoom src="/path/to/image.jpg" zoomSrc="/path/to/zoom-image.jpg" />
```

This is the simplest usage. For additional examples, visit the [demo page](https://laurenashpole.github.io/react-inner-image-zoom).


## Props

### Sources

This prop accepts an array of objects which it uses to create a picture tag and source elements. The component looks for the following optional properties and you can find additional details on responsive images [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Responsive_images):

Prop | Type | Default | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
srcSet | String | | Srcset attribute for source tag.
sizes | String | | Sizes attribute for source tag.
media | String | | An attribute containing a media condition for use with the srcset.
type | String | | An image MIME type. This is useful for using newer formats like WebP.

## Issues

Please submit issues or requests [here](https://github.com/laurenashpole/react-inner-image-zoom/issues).

Most of the implementation choices for this component are based on use cases I've encountered in the past. For example, I chose a click to zoom trigger because it's been the most requested on product detail pages I've worked on. If there's a demand for zoom on hover or other additional functionality, I'd be open to looking into it so feel free to ask.
